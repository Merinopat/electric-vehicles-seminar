Road travel is responsible for three-quarters of transport emissions, with passenger vehicles (cars and buses) contributing 45.1\%, and trucks carrying freight accounting for 29.4\%. \cite{owid-co2-emissions-from-transport}

The European Union's decision to prohibit the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2035 have accelerated governments to act promptly to achieving climate neutrality by 2050. \cite{TopicsEuParliament}

As mentioned in Section \ref{sec: charg}, the development of charging stations is a key measure to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. The previous government aimed for 15 million fully electric passenger cars by 2030, a challenging goal. The current government under Chancellor Merz has introduced an 8-step plan for EVs, including:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Increasing the tax incentive limit for company cars to €100,000 (up from €70,000) \cite{FrankfurterRundschau}.
	\item A special depreciation allowance for electric vehicles.
	\item Vehicle tax exemption for EVs until 2035 \cite{BusinessInsider}.
	%\item Support for low- and medium-income households transitioning to climate-friendly mobility, funded by the EU Climate Social Fund.
	%\item Promotion of plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) and electric vehicles with range extenders (EREVs) and corresponding European regulations.
	%\item Acceleration of charging network expansion, including fast-charging stations and commercial depot charging.
	%\item Toll exemptions for zero-emission trucks after 2026.
	%\item Promotion of hydrogen infrastructure for commercial vehicles \cite{BusinessInsider}.
\end{enumerate}
To accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles, a range of incentives can be implemented. These include monetary incentives such as purchase premiums, scrappage bonuses, subsidized loans, special depreciation schemes for commercial EVs, and tax benefits. Non-monetary incentives involve measures like reserved parking spots, access to bus lanes, dedicated EV lanes or charging zones, low-emission zones, and congestion charges based on pollution levels. \cite{owid-co2-emissions-from-transport}
